[Paper](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Aziere_Ensemble_Deep_Manifold_Similarity_Learning_Using_Hard_Proxies_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf)

- No code available
- we search in the deep space for proxies that are as close to one another as possible, but still belong to their respective subspaces of the deep feature space corresponding to the meta-classes


## Method
Learns an ensemble of $$E$$ CNNs.
